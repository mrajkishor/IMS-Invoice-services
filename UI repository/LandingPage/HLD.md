### High Level Design 

### 1. **Architecture Overview**
   - **Frontend**: React Native app for Android (and potentially iOS).
   - **Backend**: A RESTful API or GraphQL service to handle invoice creation, storage, and retrieval.
   - **Database**: Store invoice data, template information, and URLs.
   - **File Storage**: Store static files like invoice templates, either in your database or a service like AWS S3.
   - **Web Hosting**: Host the invoice pages on a static website generator or a simple web server (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3 with CloudFront).

### 2. **Workflow**

#### **Invoice Creation**
   - **Template Selection**: The shopkeeper selects a template.
   - **Data Entry**: The shopkeeper fills in the necessary data for the invoice.
   - **Save Invoice**: The invoice is saved in the database with a unique ID.

#### **URL Generation**
   - **Generate Unique URL**: When the shopkeeper clicks the share button, generate a unique hash or ID for the invoice.
   - **Store URL**: Save this URL in the database, linking it to the invoice data.

#### **Webpage Rendering**
   - **Static Page Generation**: Create a static HTML page for the invoice. The page is read-only and pulls data from the backend using the unique URL.
   - **Host Webpage**: Host the static HTML page on your web server or a static site generator.

#### **URL Access**
   - **Permanent Access**: The unique URL points to a static page where the invoice data is displayed. The shopkeeper and customer can access this page on any device.
   - **Read-Only View**: Ensure the invoice data is presented in a read-only format, without any edit options.

#### **Invoice Management**
   - **Delete Option**: Provide an option in the React Native app for the shopkeeper to delete an invoice. This should remove the associated URL and static page.
   - **Recreate URL for Updated Invoice**: If the invoice needs to be updated, the shopkeeper must delete the old one and create a new one with a new URL.

### 3. **Tech Stack Suggestions**

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Next.js for API, MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for storing static files or template data.
- **Frontend**: React Native for the mobile app, and React.js for the static page rendering.
- **Web Hosting**: Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3 with CloudFront for hosting static pages.

### 4. **Security Considerations**
   - **Authentication**: Secure the React Native app with proper authentication (JWT or OAuth).
   - **Authorization**: Ensure that only the shopkeeper can delete or regenerate URLs.
   - **Data Privacy**: Encrypt sensitive data and ensure secure storage and transmission.

### 5. **Scalability**
   - **Database Scaling**: Choose a database that scales well with read-heavy operations since invoices will be frequently accessed.
   - **Static Content Delivery**: Use a CDN (like CloudFront) to serve static pages globally with low latency.
