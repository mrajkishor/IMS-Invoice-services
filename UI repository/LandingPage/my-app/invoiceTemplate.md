### Common Invoice Statuses:

1. **Unpaid/Pending**:
   - **Meaning:** The invoice has been issued but not yet paid by the customer. This is typically the default status when an invoice is first created.
   - **Example:** The invoice is sent to the client, and the payment is expected but has not yet been received.

2. **Paid**:
   - **Meaning:** The invoice has been fully paid by the customer. No further action is required.
   - **Example:** The customer has completed the payment, and the transaction is closed.

3. **Overdue**:
   - **Meaning:** The invoice has not been paid, and the due date has passed. This status often triggers follow-up actions such as reminders or late fees.
   - **Example:** The payment was due on August 1st, 2024, but as of August 10th, 2024, it has not been received.

4. **Partially Paid**:
   - **Meaning:** A portion of the invoice amount has been paid, but the full amount is still outstanding.
   - **Example:** The total invoice amount is $1,000, but the customer has only paid $600. The remaining $400 is still due.

5. **Cancelled**:
   - **Meaning:** The invoice has been voided or cancelled, and no payment is expected. This might happen if the order is cancelled or if there was an error in the original invoice.
   - **Example:** The customer decided to cancel the order, and the invoice is no longer valid.

6. **Disputed**:
   - **Meaning:** The customer has raised a dispute regarding the invoice, and payment is on hold until the issue is resolved.
   - **Example:** The customer may question the charges or the amount, and the payment process is paused while the issue is addressed.

7. **Draft**:
   - **Meaning:** The invoice is in a draft state, meaning it has been created but not yet finalized or sent to the customer.
   - **Example:** You might save an invoice as a draft if you’re waiting for final confirmation before issuing it.

8. **Processing**:
   - **Meaning:** The invoice is currently being processed for payment. This status might be used in automated systems or when waiting for payment to clear.
   - **Example:** The payment has been initiated but not yet confirmed.

### Why Status Matters:
- **Tracking**: Helps both the seller and buyer keep track of where the invoice is in the payment process.
- **Follow-Up**: Enables the seller to know when to send reminders, apply late fees, or take other actions based on the payment status.
- **Record-Keeping**: Provides a clear history of the invoice’s journey from creation to payment.


## About due date

The "Due Date" on an invoice refers to the deadline by which the payment for the goods or services listed on the invoice is expected to be made. It is the final date by which the payment must be received to avoid late fees or penalties, and it helps both the seller and buyer manage their finances and obligations.

The due date is usually set based on the payment terms agreed upon between the seller and the buyer. Common payment terms include:

- **Net 30**: Payment is due 30 days after the invoice date.
- **Net 15**: Payment is due 15 days after the invoice date.
- **Due on Receipt**: Payment is due immediately upon receipt of the invoice.
- **End of Month (EOM)**: Payment is due at the end of the month in which the invoice was issued.

For example, if an invoice is dated August 1st and the payment terms are Net 30, the due date would be August 31st. If the payment is not made by the due date, the seller might apply late fees or take further action to collect the payment.
